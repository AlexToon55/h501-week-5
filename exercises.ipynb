    "1. Create a new column in the Titanic dataset that classifies passengers into age categories (i.e., a pandas `category` series). The categories should be:\n",
    "    - Teen (13–19)  \n",
    "    - Adult (20–59)\n",
    "    - Senior (60+)  \n",

    "    - The number of survivors  \n",

    "\n",
    "4. Order the results so they are easy to interpret.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Come up with a clear question that your results table makes you curious about (e.g., “Did women in first class have a higher survival rate than men in other classes?”). Write this question in your `app.py` file above the call to your visualization function, using `st.write(\"Your Question Here\")`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. Create a Plotly visualization in a function named `visualize_demographic()` that directly addresses your question by returning a Plotly figure (e.g., `fig = px. ...`). You are free to choose the chart type that you think best communicates the findings. Be creative — try different approaches, compare them, and ensure that your chart clearly answers the question you posed.\n"

    "\n",
